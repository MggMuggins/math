# Math Utility
A small utility for finding significant numbers from a set of numbers, as a learning experience.

# In-program Helpsheet
My program to find different significant values from a set of inputs.
Input values via args and Files. Any arguments left after defined POSIX args are parsed
are read into the input array.
Significant value outputs currently supported include:

   Least Common Multiple
	
   Greatest Common Factor
   
   Largest Number
   
   Smallest Number

Options:

--help, -h

  Display this help and exits. Overrides all other arguments.

--input, -i

   Uses numerical arguments as input. This option must be specified to take arguments!

--file, -f

   Reads input from a file specified as the next argument in the command. This must be a full file path!

--gcf, -g

   Prints the gcf of the input as part of the output. Uses 'GCF = [output]' as output format.

--lcm, -l

  Prints the lcm of the input as part of the output. Uses 'LCM = [output]' as output format.

--big, -b

  Prints the largest number from the input as part of the output. Uses 'Big = [output]' as output format.

--small, -s

  Prints the smallest number from the input as part of the output. Uses 'Small = [output]' as output format.

# Building
Building is fairly straightforward, as this is a dub project. Simply ```cd``` into the base repository directory and run ```dub build``` to build, or ```dub run``` to build and run. The executable will be located in the main directory, and will be ignored by this repository, as will any object code or other platform-specific stuff generated by dub. If you end up with generated content that should not be included in the repository, please add it to the gitignore.

See codemap.txt for a mapping of all functions.

More functions are always wanted! If you want to write one, do so and open a pull request! If you don't know how to write one, let me know, and I'll add it!
