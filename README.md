# Math Utility
A small utility for finding significant numbers from a set of numbers, as a learning experience.

# In-program Helpsheet
My program to find different significant values from a set of inputs.
Input values via args and/or Files. Any arguments left after defined POSIX args are parsed
are read into the input array.
Significant value outputs currently supported include:

   Least Common Multiple
	
   Greatest Common Factor

Options:

--help, -h

 Display this help and exits. Overrides all other arguments.
		
--input, -i

   Uses numerical arguments as input. This option must be specified to take arguments!
		
--file, -f

   Reads input from a file instead of taking command line args.
		
--gcf, -g

   Prints the gcf as part of the output. Uses 'GCF = <output>' as output format.
		
--lcm, -l

  Prints the lcm as part of the output. Uses 'LCM = <output>' as output format.

# Building
Building is fairly straightforward, as this is a dub project. Simply ```cd``` into the base repository directory and run ```dub build``` to build, or ```dub run``` to build and run. The executable will be located in the main directory, and will be ignored by this repository, as will any object code or other platform-specific stuff generated by dub. If you end up with generated content that should not be included in the repository, please add it to the gitignore.
